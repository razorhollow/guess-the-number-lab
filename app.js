// 5. Add a `render` method to `game` that `play` will call after a guess has been made that alerts:
//   - If the secret has been guessed: `Congrats! You guessed the number in [number of prevGuesses]!`
//   - Otherwise: `Your guess is too [high|low] Previous guesses: x, x, x, x`
//   - Hints:
//       - `render` wonâ€™t be able to access any of `play`â€™s local variables, e.g., `guess`, so be sure pass `render` any arguments as needed (you may not have built your program to use any, that's ok if that's the case!)
//       - Template literals not only have interpolation, but they also honor whitespace - including line breaks!
//       - The list of previous guesses can be generated using the array `join` method.
// 6. The `play` method should end (`return`) when the guess matches `secretNum`.

// ## Level Up ðŸš€

// - If the player enters a number greater than the `secretNum` make it the new `biggestNum`, so that the player can't enter a number greater than it. If the player enters a number that is less than the `secretNum` make it the new `smallestNum`, so that the player can't enter a number less than it. Hint: You may want to add a helper function to accomplish this.

// ## More Level Up ðŸš€

// When `play` is run, immediately prompt the player to enter the smallest and biggest numbers instead of pre-setting values.
