// ## Level Up ðŸš€

// - If the player enters a number greater than the `secretNum` make it the new `biggestNum`, so that the player can't enter a number greater than it. If the player enters a number that is less than the `secretNum` make it the new `smallestNum`, so that the player can't enter a number less than it. Hint: You may want to add a helper function to accomplish this.

// ## More Level Up ðŸš€

// When `play` is run, immediately prompt the player to enter the smallest and biggest numbers instead of pre-setting values.
